Topics include a comparative examination of Indigenous experiences of colonialism, including treaties and land surrenders as well as the development of government policies aimed at removing and/or assimilating Great Lakes peoples. This course will also study resistance by First National and Tribal Councils to those programs over nearly two centuries and assess local strategies used for economic and cultural survival.", "title": "Indigenous Histories of the Great Lakes, 1815 to the Present", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "<p>HIS263Y1/ HIS264H1/ HIS271Y1/ INS200H1/ INS201Y1</p>", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "<p>HIS366H1/ HIS369Y1</p>", "recommendedPreparation": "", "note": null, "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Society and its Institutions (3)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Humanities"], "publicationSections": ["History"], "cmPublicationSections": [{"section": "History", "subSections": null}]}, "created": "2025-04-11@23:16:30.109", "modified": null, "lastSaved": 0, "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "coSec": {"code": "ASABS", "name": "Indigenous Studies - Arts & Science"}, "department": {"code": "HIS", "name": "Department of History"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": 0.5, "minCredit": 0.5, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Society Institutions", "description": "BR=3 Society and Its Institutions", "code": "BR=3"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": ""}], "cancelInd": "", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "primaryFull": false, "fullyOnline": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false}]}
