But before you can revise, you need to see your writing afresh. How can you escape the \"intractable subjectivity\" (Joseph Williams) of composition? How can you communicate your ideas more compellingly? INI 409 teaches ways to understand this essential stage of the writing process. It investigates different steps in self-editing: detaching from a first draft, reviewing it on different levels, identifying possible issues, and strengthening weak spots. We will draw on professional editorial strategies and time-tested writing advice to help us analyze both content and expression. Writers in different genres (scholarship, journalism, fiction) will visit the class to share their revision strategies. Each student will need a piece of writing to work on, one that the student wants to improve. It could be an academic essay or a science report from an earlier term, a short story or a piece of creative nonfiction, a newspaper article, or a personal statement for post-graduate applications. Course assignments will include applying revision strategies to this text.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>Delivery Instructions</strong>\n<br>\n<p><strong>*Prerequisite waived for 2021 Summer: permission of the instructor is not required*</strong>&nbsp;This is an online synchronous course.
