This component will take on average about one hour for every class meeting. This section of the course is self-paced and not reliant on a meeting schedule, but students will have to complete it before the active learning sessions of the course (consisting of 2 hours of instruction), which are live-streamed, delivered synchronously per the meeting schedule. In summary, because this is a Y course, it consists of 2 asynchronous hours + 4 synchronous hours every week. Students need to use several functions within Quercus (Discussion Boards, BB Collaborate), the ability to use MS Teams and/or Zoom for interactive sessions, a webcam and a microphone.
