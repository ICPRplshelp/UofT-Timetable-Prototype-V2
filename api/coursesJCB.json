Teams will be comprised of at least three students, with representation from at least three areas of specialization, namely, astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth sciences or physics. The interdisciplinary projects will be based on current trends in research and student teams will work to complete their projects with guidance provided by a team of faculty advisors from the Biology Department and the Department of Chemical and Physical Sciences. In addition to the rigorous development of research skills, the course will also provide students with training and practical experience in project management techniques and teamwork skills development. JCB487Y5 requires submitting an application to the department before the end of June for Fall enrolment. Application forms may be found at http://uoft.me/cpsforms. Application should be submitted to the CPS Undergraduate Assistant. Registration on ACORN is also required.", "title": "Advanced Interdisciplinary Research Laboratory", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "(2.0 credits at the 300 level from BIO or CHM or JBC or JCP or ERS or ESS(G) or PHY) and (1.0 credit from BIO206H5 or BIO314H5 or CHM372H5 or CHM373H5 or CHM394H5 or CHM395H5 or CHM396H5 or CHM397H5 or ERS201H5 or ERS202H5 or PHY324H5 or PHY347H5).
