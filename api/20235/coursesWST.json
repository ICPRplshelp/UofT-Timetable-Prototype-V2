But what is abolition? What is its significance as a theory of change, a body of scholarship, and as a practice? This course explores how leading abolitionist and feminist thinkers theorize the state, punishment, criminalization, the root causes of violence, and the meaning of safety. It explores the historical genealogies of abolitionist thought and practice in relation to shifting forms of racial, gendered and economic violence. Students will analyze the works of formerly enslaved and free Black abolitionists, prison writings during the Black Power Era as well as canonical scholarly texts in the field. A central focus of the course is contemporary abolitionist feminist thought. The course is conceptually grounded in Black and queer feminisms, and features works by Indigenous, South Asian women and other women of colour.", "title": "Abolition Feminisms", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "<p>[[WSTA03H3 and WSTB11H3] and [WSTB22H3 or WSTC26H3] and [1.0 additional credit in WST]] or [1.0 credit in WST and 6.0 credits in any other Humanities or Social Sciences discipline]</p>", "corequisitesText": null, "exclusionsText": null, "recommendedPreparation": "<p>HISB22H3/WSTB22H3, WSTC26H3</p>", "note": null, "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "breadthRequirements": ["History, Philosophy & Cultural Studies"], "publicationSections": ["Women's and Gender Studies"], "cmPublicationSections": {"cmPublicationSections": {"section": "Women's and Gender Studies"}}}, "created": "2023-07-23@00:25:18.968", "modified": null, "lastSaved": "0", "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "SCAR", "name": "University of Toronto Scarborough"}, "coSec": {"code": null, "name": null}, "department": {"code": "HCSSC", "name": "Dept. of Historical & Cultural Studies (UTSC)"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": "0.50", "minCredit": "0.50", "breadths": null, "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": "<p class=\"info\"><b>Enrolment Control: P</b><BR>\r\nInitially restricted to <B>3rd and 4th year</b> students in Women's and Gender Studies Major and Minor Programs.\r\n<BR>\r\nStarting <b>Wednesday, April 5th,</b> if there is no waitlist, any remaining spaces may open to other UTSC students with prerequisites.</p>"}], "cancelInd": null, "subscriptionTtb": "false", "subscriptionOpenData": "false", "tb1Active": "false", "tb2Active": "false", "fullyOnline": "false"}]}
