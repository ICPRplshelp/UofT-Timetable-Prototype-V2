The thesis provides students with an opportunity to conduct, document, and experience engineering related research as an undergraduate student. This course is structured to provide resources to support that process, in particular the documentation of research, through a series of lectures and workshops. While the final thesis document is the main deliverable, students are also required to submit a set of interim deliverables to support ongoing documentation and reflection.", "title": "Thesis", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": null, "corequisitesText": null, "exclusionsText": "CHE499Y1", "recommendedPreparation": "ESC301H1", "note": null, "division": "Applied Science & Engineering, Faculty of", "publicationSections": ["Engineering Science"], "cmPublicationSections": {"cmPublicationSections": {"section": "Engineering Science"}}}, "created": "2023-07-20@03:39:00.636", "modified": null, "lastSaved": "0", "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "APSC", "name": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"}, "coSec": {"code": null, "name": null}, "department": {"code": "ESC", "name": "Division of Engineering Science"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": "1.00", "minCredit": "1.00", "breadths": null, "notes": null, "cancelInd": null, "subscriptionTtb": "false", "subscriptionOpenData": "false", "tb1Active": "false", "tb2Active": "false", "fullyOnline": "false"}]}
