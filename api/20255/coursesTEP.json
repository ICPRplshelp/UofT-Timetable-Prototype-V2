A key is understanding engineers lead in ways that reflect their skills and mind set. Learning frameworks and personal working styles inventories provide practical tools to assist the student to understand human nature and to become a competent leader of self and of teams. The student prepares to become a competent leader by first developing a deeper understanding of self and then undertaking to learn (understand and integrate) key skills, character attributes,and purposeful behaviours. Strategies for development of high-performance teams are also presented. The material is delivered through lectures, readings, in-class discussion and a team project. Attendance is mandatory to enable learning through experiential activities and critical reflection.The project is based on the team interviewing a senior leader at an engineering-intensive company or senior leader in the community", "title": "Engineering Leadership", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "", "recommendedPreparation": "", "note": null, "division": "Applied Science & Engineering, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": null, "distributionRequirements": null, "publicationSections": ["Applied Science and Engineering (Interdepartmental)", "Certificate Programs in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering", "Minors in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering", "ISTEP"], "cmPublicationSections": [{"section": "Applied Science and Engineering (Interdepartmental)", "subSections": null}, {"section": "Certificate Programs in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering", "subSections": null}, {"section": "Minors in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering", "subSections": null}, {"section": "ISTEP", "subSections": null}]}, "created": "2025-04-11@23:15:00.061", "modified": null, "lastSaved": 0, "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "APSC", "name": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"}, "coSec": {"code": "", "name": null}, "department": {"code": "ISTEP", "name": "Inst for Studies in Transdisciplinary Engin Educ & Practice"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": 0.5, "minCredit": 0.5, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "APSC", "name": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "ELECTIVE", "type": "Compl Studies", "description": "Complementary Studies", "code": "CS"}]}], "notes": [], "cancelInd": "", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false, "fullyOnline": false, "primaryFull": false}, {"id": "67a3e7110e7deb7f47056919", "name": "Positive Psychology for Engineers", "ucName": null, "code": "TEP444H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20255F"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 2, "millisofday": 54000000}, "end": {"day": 2, "millisofday": 64800000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "OI", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingRoomSuffix": "", "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494563", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20255F", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}, {"start": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 54000000}, "end": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 64800000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "OI", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingRoomSuffix": "", "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494563", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20255F", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}], "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": [{"firstName": "Robin", "lastName": "Sacks"}], "currentEnrolment": 117, "maxEnrolment": 120, "subTitle": "", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20255F", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": 0, "enrolmentInd": "", "tbaInd": "N", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [{"yearOfStudy": "*", "post": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subject": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subjectPost": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "typeOfProgram": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "designation": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "primaryOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "associatedOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "secondOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "adminOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "collaborativeOrgGroupCode": "*", "quantity": 120, "sequence": 1}], "linkedMeetingSections": null}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "Humanities and Social Science elective Many disciplines have explored happiness - philosophy, anthropology, psychology, sociology, neurobiology, film, art and literature - to name a few.
