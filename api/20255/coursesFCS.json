A comparative approach based on various examples taken from literary, philosophical texts and from film adaptations will examine the concept of love and its many definitions. Selections from ancient and modern philosophical texts on love, sex, and desire will be the starting point of our discussions: Ovid, \"The Art of Love\", Plato, \"The Symposium\", Bataille, \"Eroticism\", Beauvoir, \"The Woman in Love\", and Foucault, \"The History of Sexuality\". The course will be taught in English. Students who are proficient in French and intend to complete their readings and major tests in French (Online Essay and Online Film Analysis) in order to count this course towards a program in French (Major or Specialist only), should inform the Course Instructor of their decision by the end of the first week of classes. N.B.
