By delving into the tough decisions and trade-offs the poor face\u2014often matters of life and death\u2014we aim to shed light on how better policies and approaches can be designed to address global poverty effectively. While external solutions to poverty often dominate the conversation, we will uncover the remarkable, innovative strategies that people in poverty develop to navigate their circumstances. Surviving on meager resources requires extraordinary decision-making and adaptability. Understanding these decisions and trade-offs is a crucial starting point in the fight against poverty. Throughout the course, we will explore questions such as: How do the poor organize their social and economic lives? Why are larger families more common among the poor? How do they prepare for emergencies and old age with limited resources? By the end of the course, students will gain deep insights into the lives of the poor, understanding how seemingly irrational choices often make perfect sense in their context. While our analysis will entail an economic perspective, we will embrace a broad, interdisciplinary approach to foster rich discussions.&nbsp;No prior knowledge of economics is required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you do not have the course prerequisites but would like to take the course, please contact <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:undergraduatecoordinator.munkschool@utoronto.ca\">undergraduatecoordinator.munkschool@utoronto.ca.&nbsp;</a></p>"}], "cancelInd": "", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "primaryFull": false, "fullyOnline": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false}]}
