Note: if the preferred section is full and you add yourself to the waitlist, your enrolment in the original section will be cancelled. Section changes can be made on ACORN until the last day to add courses for the session provided there is space to do so.\n<br><br>\nStudents are expected to enroll or waitlist for course meeting sections that fit in a conflict-free schedule. Students who knowingly enroll in a course that causes a conflict should not expect to request a section change through their Professor at a later date.\n<br><br>\n<b>Please see Calendar for overall course load limit for BBA students</b></p>"}], "cancelInd": "N", "subscriptionTtb": "false", "subscriptionOpenData": "false", "fullyOnline": "false"}]}
