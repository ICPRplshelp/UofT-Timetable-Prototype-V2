Strategic use of technology in all sorts of businesses makes the difference between success and failure for these firms. Wealth creation is a real option for many and the business atmosphere is ready for you! Increasingly, people are seeing the advantages of doing their own thing, in their own way, in their own time. Entrepreneurs can control their own lives, structure their own progress and be accountable for their own success - they can fail, but they can not be fired! After all, engineers are the most capable people to be in the forefront of this drive to the business life of the next century. This course is the first of a series of two dealing with entrepreneurship and management of a small company. It is intended that the student would continue to take the follow up course APS432 as s/he progresses toward the engineering degree. Therefore, it is advisable that the descriptions of both courses be studied prior to deciding to take this one. This is a limited enrolment course. If the number of students electing to take the course exceeds the class size limit, selection of the final group will be made on the basis of the \"Entrepreneur's Test\". There will be a certificate awarded upon the successful completion of both courses attesting to the fact that the student has passed this Entrepreneurial Course Series at the University of Toronto. The course is based on real life issues, not theoretical developments or untried options. Topics covered include: Who is an entrepreneur; Canadian business environment; Acquisitions; Different business types (retail, wholesale, manufacturing, and services); Franchising; Human resources, Leadership, Business law; and many others. Several visitors are invited to provide the student with the opportunity to meet real entrepreneurs. There will be several assignments and a session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.", "title": "Entrepreneurship and Small Business", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": null, "corequisitesText": null, "exclusionsText": "CHE488H1/CIV488H1/ECE488H1/MIE488H1/MSE488H1/APS281H1", "recommendedPreparation": null, "note": null, "division": "Applied Science & Engineering, Faculty of", "publicationSections": ["Applied Science and Engineering (Interdepartmental)", "Certificate Programs in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering", "Minors in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering", "ISTEP"]}, "created": "2023-01-23@23:46:58.141", "modified": null, "lastSaved": "0", "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "APSC", "name": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"}, "coSec": null, "department": {"code": "ISTEP", "name": "Inst for Studies in Transdisciplinary Engin Educ & Practice"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": "0.50", "minCredit": "0.50", "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "APSC", "name": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"}, "breadthTypes": [{"type": "Compl Studies", "description": "Complementary Studies", "code": "CS"}]}], "notes": null, "cancelInd": null, "subscriptionTtb": "false", "subscriptionOpenData": "false", "fullyOnline": "false"}, {"id": "629dec8ccc54df41c2bea60c", "name": "LANGUAGE AND MEANING", "ucName": null, "code": "TEP281H1", "sectionCode": "S", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20231"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": "1", "millisofday": "64800000"}, "end": {"day": "1", "millisofday": "72000000"}, "building": {"buildingCode": "BA", "buildingRoomNumber": "2195", "buildingRoomSuffix": null, "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494470", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20231", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}], "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": [{"firstName": "Penny", "lastName": "Kinnear"}], "currentEnrolment": "28", "maxEnrolment": "40", "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20231", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": "0", "enrolmentInd": null, "tbaInd": "N", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": null, "enrolmentControls": [{"yearOfStudy": "*", "post": {"code": null, "name": null}, "subject": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subjectPost": {"code": null, "name": null}, "typeOfProgram": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "designation": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "primaryOrg": {"code": "APSC", "name": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"}, "associatedOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "secondOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "adminOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "collaborativeOrgGroupCode": "*", "quantity": "40", "sequence": "1"}]}, {"name": "TUT0101", "type": "Tutorial", "teachMethod": "TUT", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": "4", "millisofday": "64800000"}, "end": {"day": "4", "millisofday": "72000000"}, "building": {"buildingCode": "BA", "buildingRoomNumber": "2195", "buildingRoomSuffix": null, "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494470", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20231", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}], "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": null, "currentEnrolment": "28", "maxEnrolment": "40", "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20231", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": "0", "enrolmentInd": null, "tbaInd": "N", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": null, "enrolmentControls": [{"yearOfStudy": "*", "post": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subject": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subjectPost": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "typeOfProgram": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "designation": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "primaryOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "associatedOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "secondOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "adminOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "collaborativeOrgGroupCode": "*", "quantity": "40", "sequence": "1"}]}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "Humanities and Social Science elective As students study how language is used to make meaning in diverse contexts they will hone their own skills in deploying written and oral professional engineering language.

The student considering taking this course would typically plan to pursue a career in small business started by themselves, or in a family enterprise. The skills acquired, however, are very useful in any business where a graduate might end up in their career, without the need for actually being an entrepreneur. Our approach to teaching is based on real-life business experiences and many years of successful practice of \"what we preach\". The course contains very little theoretical work or academic approaches. It is designed to familiarise you with the kinds of opportunities (problems) likely to be encountered in an entrepreneurial career. If you really want this lifestyle and are prepared to work hard, we will provide you with the practical knowledge and technical skills required to pursue this kind of career. Topics covered in this course include: Marketing and Sales; Legal issues; Financing the business; Human Resources challenges, the Business Plan and many other issues. Note that the course material may be adjusted between the two courses as required. We recognize the value of communication skills in both the classroom and in project reports. In fact, we require that you learn how to present yourself in a business-like manner. As and when appropriate, outside visitors from the business community will join in and contribute to the class discussions. The course deals with practical concepts, actual past and current events and is presented from the point of view of someone who has \"done it all\". This means that what you hear is the real stuff. There will be several assignments and the preparation of a full Business Plan as the session project.

Then we turn our attention to our own domain-expertise, applying engineering concepts like \"balance\", \"flow\", \"amplitude\", \"dynamic equilibrium\"\"momentum\" and others to explore the ways that your technical knowledge can contribute to a deep understanding of happiness.
