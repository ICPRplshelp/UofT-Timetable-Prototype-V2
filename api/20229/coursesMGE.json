At this time, all students (BBA, Major program and non-program) will have equal access to the courses, or the opportunity to waitlist.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll MGE courses that are full by <b>Monday, July 18th</b>, will <b>NOT</b> be opened to non-program students.  These courses may be made available to non-program students later if there are spaces. Students are expected to check ACORN on a regular basis for course availability.\r\n<br/><b>Note:</b> BBA students are no longer allowed to use STAB22H3 or STAB23H3 to fulfill program requirements and they will be restricted from taking STAB22H3 and STAB23H3. BBA students who have completed STAB22H3 after August 2012 or STAB23H3 <b>ARE REQUIRED</b> to take <b>MGEB11H3 as EXTRA</b> before enrolling themselves into <b>MGEB12H3</b>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ECONOMIC MEETING SECTION CHANGES:</b> Students approved in a course who wish to change sections may do so on ACORN, provided there is space in the preferred section. Note: if the preferred section is full and you add yourself to the waitlist, your enrolment in the original course will be cancelled. Section changes can be made on ACORN until the last day to add courses for the session, provided there is space to do so.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>IMPORTANT MESSAGE REGARDING MEETING SECTIONS:</b> Students are expected to enroll or waitlist for course meeting sections that fit in a conflict-free schedule. Students who knowingly enroll in a course that causes a conflict should not expect to be granted a section change at a later date.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Please see Calendar for overall course load limit for Bachelor in Business Administration students</b></p>"}], "cancelInd": "N", "subscriptionTtb": "false", "subscriptionOpenData": "false", "fullyOnline": "false"}, {"id": "6294b25dd0c5d471cbf94d6f", "name": "Supervised Reading", "ucName": null, "code": "MGED90H3", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "Scarborough", "sessions": ["20229"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC01", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "01", "meetingTimes": null, "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": [{"firstName": null, "lastName": "FACULTY"}], "currentEnrolment": "0", "maxEnrolment": "9999", "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20229", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": "0", "enrolmentInd": "A", "tbaInd": "Y", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": null}], "enrolmentControls": null}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "These courses will normally be made available only to upper-level students whose interests are not covered by other courses and whose performance in Economics courses has been well above average.
