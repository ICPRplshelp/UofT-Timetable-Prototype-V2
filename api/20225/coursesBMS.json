The production, distribution, monetization, and reception of media content increasingly takes place on and through powerful platforms like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitch, and more. Legacy media industries are still adapting to digital distribution and on-demand video streaming, while millions of small-scale content creators seek to attract an audience on social media and user-generated content platforms. For the platforms this is an extremely profitable arrangement, and major media conglomerates along with a tiny percentage of celebrity creators and influencers share in this success. But the majority of aspiring cultural producers are dreamers, struggling to reach an audience and make ends meet. This advanced seminar will explore the ongoing \u201cplatformization\u201d of cultural production through cutting-edge research and case studies, investigating its implications for different media industries and cultural forms from perspectives including political economy, labour, creativity, celebrity, and governance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommended Prep: </strong>SMC316:Social Technology &amp; Networks / BMS316:Social Media &amp; Digital Platforms</p>"}]}]}
