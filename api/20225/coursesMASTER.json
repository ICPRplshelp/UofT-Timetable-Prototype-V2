The production, distribution, monetization, and reception of media content increasingly takes place on and through powerful platforms like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitch, and more. Legacy media industries are still adapting to digital distribution and on-demand video streaming, while millions of small-scale content creators seek to attract an audience on social media and user-generated content platforms. For the platforms this is an extremely profitable arrangement, and major media conglomerates along with a tiny percentage of celebrity creators and influencers share in this success. But the majority of aspiring cultural producers are dreamers, struggling to reach an audience and make ends meet. This advanced seminar will explore the ongoing \u201cplatformization\u201d of cultural production through cutting-edge research and case studies, investigating its implications for different media industries and cultural forms from perspectives including political economy, labour, creativity, celebrity, and governance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommended Prep: </strong>SMC316:Social Technology &amp; Networks / BMS316:Social Media &amp; Digital Platforms</p>"}]}, {"name": "Meditation and the Body", "code": "BPM335H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20225F"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 1, "millisofday": 36000000}, "end": {"day": 1, "millisofday": 46800000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20225F"}, {"start": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 36000000}, "end": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 46800000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20225F"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "P.", "lastName": "Whissell"}], "currentEnrolment": "141", "maxEnrolment": "142", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": "P", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20225F", "mode": "SYNC"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "<p>In recent years, the effects of meditation on the body have been widely researched.

They will practice reading and understanding mathematical statements, analyzing definitions and properties, formulating conjectures and generalizations, providing and writing reasonable and precise arguments, writing and critiquing proofs. The instructor may use specific mathematical content, which could vary from year to year, to practice these skills. The course is aimed at students interested in the creative character of mathematics, particularly those planning to take any of our proof-oriented courses, and is an excellent preparation for MAT137Y1, MAT157Y1, or MAT240H1.</p> <br /> <p>Note: students may take this course concurrently with MAT157Y1 or MAT137Y1, or prior to registering in MAT157Y1 or MAT137Y1.

Through an examination of a mix of theoretical frameworks and case studies from Toronto and elsewhere, you will gain an understanding of the ways in which effective public participation can contribute to the maintenance of a healthy democratic society while also exploring some of the key challenges and opportunities faced by public participation practitioners today. The course has two key objectives: to give you a practical understanding of all of the elements of an effective public participation process, and to explore how public participation processes can be designed to be more inclusive and effective. In addition, students will be able to apply this knowledge towards the development of a project or report for a client.
