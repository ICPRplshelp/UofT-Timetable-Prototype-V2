Is there such a thing as the public good? This seminar course examines the notion of the \u201cpublic\u201d through investigating possible answers to a central political question: what is the purpose of government? Drawing on readings in philosophy and political theory, the course considers a variety of approaches to interpreting the nature of the public good and asks how policy makers should respond when competing goods (e.g., freedom and security) clash with each other. The course involves discussion of contemporary issues in public policy. Restricted to first-year students.

In part two of the course, we will study Karl Marx, who coined the term \u201ccapitalism\u201d to describe the new type of society that had emerged as a product of the Industrial Revolution. Marx, as the severest critic of the capitalist system, called attention to its alienating character. In the 19th Century, his ideas provoked a response that accounts, in large measure, for the character of Western political thought. The discussion of Marx is therefore followed by the intense debate with his \u201cghost,\u201d the Marxian legacy.
