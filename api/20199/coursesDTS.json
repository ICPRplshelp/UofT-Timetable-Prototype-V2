In this course, we will examine such religions that have been borne in the Black Atlantic: Santeria (Cuba), Vodou (Haiti), and Candombl\u00e9 (Brazil).  Through discussion of texts from the fields of history, anthropology, and religious studies, we will investigate how these religions have often been misunderstood and under-appreciated as complex religious systems.  In addition, the class will consider the interplay between religion, race, ritual, gender, sexuality, and representation in the African Diaspora."}]}, {"name": "Advanced Topics in Diaspora and Transnationalism", "code": "DTS406H1", "sectionCode": "S", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20201"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 50400000}, "end": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 57600000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "SK", "buildingRoomNumber": "346", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20201"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "E.", "lastName": "Sammons"}], "currentEnrolment": "18", "maxEnrolment": "20", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": "PE", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20201", "mode": "CLASS"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "An in-depth investigation of topics in Diaspora and Transnationalism.
