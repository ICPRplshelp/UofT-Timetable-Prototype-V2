Reflective of the broader logics of media industry conglomeration and convergence, in media franchises movies, television series, novels and comics, games of all kinds, toys and merchandise, paratexts like promotional materials, etc. are linked together in order to maximize profits.  These dense networks of commercial products serve as a platform for new forms of serial narrative and world-building such as \"transmedia storytelling,\" and also generate vibrant, diverse fan cultures that extend far beyond the official franchise and its canonical texts.
