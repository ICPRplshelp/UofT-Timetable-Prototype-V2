Attention is given to how studies of physical culture provide answers to questions such as what it means to live in a society structured by power relations that privilege some and form the bases of injustice for others. A range of sociological, philosophical, humanities and cultural theories are used to illustrate how physical culture, sport and kinesiology are affected by historical, political and social structures and processes of knowledge production that reproduce hegemonic systems based on normativity, colonialism and racism, patriarchal capitalism, neoliberalism, speciesism, ecocide, biopedagogies and scientization. We will discuss ways in which resistance/s to these hegemonic systems can move us towards a more equitable physical culture, sport and kinesiology.", "title": "Physical Cultural Studies: Theories,

this course is that graduates who pursue careers in the broad fields of kinesiology, physical education and health \u2013 teaching, fitness and lifestyle counseling, coaching, medicine, health sciences or research \u2013 will be in positions of social responsibility and leadership in society. This course will initiate discussions about developing decolonial ethics through three intersecting dimensions: (a) the importance of reflection, vulnerability, and nonjudgmental communication, (b) the necessity to resist domination and colonial forces, and (c) the work needed to create new, alternative relationships. We take up the challenge of courageously creating ethical spaces and developing an ethical self that can respond intellectually, politically and personally to ethical dilemmas in social, political and cultural life. Selected theories and case studies will be examined, analyzed, and evaluated.", "title": "Ethics & Power in Kinesiology, Physical Education and Health Fields", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "<p>KPE200H1, Fourth year standing</p>", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "", "recommendedPreparation": "", "note": null, "division": "Kinesiology and Physical Education, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Required"], "distributionRequirements": null, "publicationSections": null, "cmPublicationSections": null}, "created": "2024-05-11@19:40:03.987", "modified": null, "lastSaved": 0, "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "FPEH", "name": "Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education"}, "coSec": {"code": "", "name": null}, "department": {"code": "FPEH", "name": "Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": 0.5, "minCredit": 0.5, "breadths": [], "notes": [], "cancelInd": "", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "fullyOnline": false, "primaryFull": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false}, {"id": "660ed68f0b7d9d3dbe57e470", "name": "International Development through Sport", "ucName": null, "code": "KPE401H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20245F"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 1, "millisofday": 43200000}, "end": {"day": 1, "millisofday": 54000000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "BN", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingRoomSuffix": "", "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494513", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20245F", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}, {"start": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 43200000}, "end": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 54000000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "BN", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingRoomSuffix": "", "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494513", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20245F", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}], "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": [{"firstName": "Simon", "lastName": "Darnell"}], "currentEnrolment": 12, "maxEnrolment": 25, "subTitle": "", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20245F", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": 0, "enrolmentInd": "", "tbaInd": "N", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [{"yearOfStudy": "*", "post": {"code": "", "name": ""}, "subject": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subjectPost": {"code": "", "name": ""}, "typeOfProgram": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "designation": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "primaryOrg": {"code": "FPEH", "name": "Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education"}, "associatedOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "secondOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "adminOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "collaborativeOrgGroupCode": "*", "quantity": 25, "sequence": 1}], "linkedMeetingSections": null}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "Increasingly, sport and physical activity are recognized and utilized as tools of international development.

The attainment of positive developmental outcomes through sport participation is influenced by factors including the manner in which sport organizations design and deliver programs and the type of relationships youth experience. Although sport participation for youth has the potential to foster developmental benefits, not all youth have positive sport experiences. In fact, as issues of athlete maltreatment in youth sport, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as well as neglect continue to emerge throughout research and media outlets, it may be argued that sport is not designed and delivered in ways that meet the psychosocial needs of young people. In order to optimize the sport experiences of youth athletes, it is important that stakeholders are aware of the potential for these negative experiences and are educated about ways in which to foster more developmentally appropriate sport. In this course students will be introduced to concepts, theories and ideologies regarding psychosocial development as well as youth maltreatment and protection as they apply to sport. Students will have the opportunity to critically discuss issues of maltreatment within youth sport and will be challenged to critique present research in addition to educational/policy initiatives intended to safeguard youth and foster positive development.
