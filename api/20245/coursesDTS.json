How have the experiences of migration and dislocation challenged the modern assumption that the nation-state should be the limit of identification? What effect has the emergence of new media of communication had upon the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? All of these questions and many more form part of the subject matter of Diaspora and Transnational Studies. This introductory course ex-amines the historical and contemporary movements of peoples and the complex issues of identity and experience to which these processes give rise as well as the creative possibilities that flow from movement and being moved. The area of study is comparative and interdisciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, history, the arts and humanities. Accordingly, this course provides the background to the subject area from diverse perspectives and introduces students to a range of key debates in the field, with particular attention to questions of history, globalization, cultural production and the creative imagination.", "title": "Introduction to Diaspora and Transnational Studies I", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "DTS201H1, DTS202H1", "recommendedPreparation": "", "note": null, "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Creative and Cultural Representations (1)", "Society and its Institutions (3)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Humanities", "Social Science"], "publicationSections": ["Diaspora and Transnational Studies"], "cmPublicationSections": [{"section": "Diaspora and Transnational Studies", "subSections": null}]}, "created": "2024-01-31@20:16:24.924", "modified": null, "lastSaved": 0, "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "coSec": {"code": "", "name": null}, "department": {"code": "DTS", "name": "Centre for Diaspora & Transnational Studies"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": 1.0, "minCredit": 1.0, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "APSC", "name": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "ELECTIVE", "type": "Compl Studies", "description": "Complementary Studies", "code": "CS"}]}, {"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Creative Cultural", "description": "BR=1 Creative and Cultural Representation", "code": "BR=1"}, {"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Society Institutions", "description": "BR=3 Society and Its Institutions", "code": "BR=3"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": "<p><strong>Delivery Instructions</strong></p><p>This is an online course.</p>"}], "cancelInd": "N", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false, "fullyOnline": false, "primaryFull": false}, {"id": "65b7a21d92eeff46b10ee096", "name": "Independent Study", "ucName": null, "code": "DTS390H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20245F"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": null, "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": null, "currentEnrolment": null, "maxEnrolment": null, "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": null, "waitlistInd": null, "deliveryModes": [], "currentWaitlist": null, "enrolmentInd": null, "tbaInd": null, "openLimitInd": null, "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": ""}], "enrolmentControls": null, "linkedMeetingSections": null}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "A scholarly project chosen by the student, approved by the Department, and supervised by one of its instructors.
