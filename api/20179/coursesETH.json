How should we live? Which course of action is the right one? When and why should we blame ourselves and/or others? We all have and exercise moral opinions; this course is about justifying them. The course begins with some critical reasoning skills, and then explores philosophical strategies for justifying moral beliefs. We will then examine some specific issues of moral and political significance before concluding with psychological mechanisms behind moral attitudes and behaviour.\r\n", "title": "Contemporary Moral Problems", "levelOfInstruction": "undergratuate", "prerequisitesText": "", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "", "recommendedPreparation": "", "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Thought, Belief and Behaviour (2)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Humanities"]}, "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Thought", "description": "BR=2 Thought, Belief and Behaviour", "code": "BR=2"}]}], "notes": []}, {"name": "Morality in Cross-Cultural Perspective", "code": "ETH230H1", "sectionCode": "S", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20181"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 54000000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 61200000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "LA", "buildingRoomNumber": "211", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20181"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "A.", "lastName": "Ancell"}], "currentEnrolment": "45", "maxEnrolment": "50", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": "P", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20181", "mode": "CLASS"}], "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": "Course Added: May 24, 2017"}], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "Is morality universal, or does it vary by time and place?
