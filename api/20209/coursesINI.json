These entangled infrastructural projects have shaped urban life across Turtle Island from the early 20th century onwards. Drawing from the work of Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Deborah Cowen, Cedric Robinson, and Audra Simpson, this course seeks to better understand how the US and Canadian settler states have leveraged infrastructure \u2013 in both its obvious and less obvious forms \u2013 as a way of responding to the \u201curban panics\u201d engendered by the evolving geographies of immigration, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class. To this end, we will explore a diversity of topics, including gentrification, broken windows policing, diasporic (sub)urbanisms, and urban poverty, to name only a few examples. We will also attend to the ways in which urban infrastructures have always doubled as a terrain for radical struggle, resistance and refusal. We will conclude this course by reflecting on the ongoing and urgent political need to work towards the abolition of carceral and settler urban regimes in all of their various guises and dimensions.</p>\n\n<strong>Delivery Instructions</strong>\n<br>\n<p>Lectures are live-streamed and recorded.
