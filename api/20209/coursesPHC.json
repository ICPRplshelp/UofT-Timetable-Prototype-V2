More narrowly, we will analyse a breadth of complex policies questions.  Examples include: the research and development global divide, policial issues influences on pharmaceutical policy, how global commitments, such as membership in the World Trade Organization, conflict with or correspond to domestic policy directions and national sovereignty.
