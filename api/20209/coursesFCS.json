Discussions and presentations will focus on the sociolinguistic concepts of language contact, bi/multilingualism, lexical innovation/renovation, language mixing, etc. in relation to youth language practices. We will be comparing major varieties of these language practices within and between the continents, and also be assessing their prospects and implications for language change.
