This course explores the molecular details of how cellular systems (e.g., secretion, cytoskeleton and signaling) are manipulated by pathogenic effectors to promote the infection process, while emphasizing interesting structural and biochemical features of effector biology along the way. The course will also compare and contrast the strategies employed by plant versus animal pathogens, and how immune systems have evolved to cope with cellular hijacking by pathogenic effector molecules. The course will be based on the primary research literature and involve a combination of lectures and critical discussions of research papers.</p>", "title": "Pathogenic Effector Biology", "levelOfInstruction": "undergratuate", "prerequisitesText": "BCH311H1/CSB349H1/MGY311Y1", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "", "recommendedPreparation": "", "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Living Things and Their Environment (4)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Science"]}, "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Living Things", "description": "BR=4 Living Things and Their Environment", "code": "BR=4"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": "<strong>Delivery Instructions</strong>\n<br>\n<p>Lectures will be held synchronously online.<br>Lecture notes will be&nbsp;available online.<br>Recorded lectures may be available for asynchronous&nbsp;viewing: TBD</p>"}]}, {"name": "Epigenetics", "code": "CSB458H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20209"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC5101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "5101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 61200000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 72000000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20209"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "A.", "lastName": "Saltzman"}], "currentEnrolment": "8", "maxEnrolment": "8", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": "P", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20209", "mode": "ONLSYNC"}], "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": "July 29, 2020: Room Changed"}], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}, {"name": "LEC6101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "6101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 61200000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 72000000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20209"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "A.", "lastName": "Saltzman"}], "currentEnrolment": "12", "maxEnrolment": "16", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": "P", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20209", "mode": "ONLSYNC"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "<p>A seminar course exploring non-Mendelian phenomena in plants, fungi and animals that reveal aspects of genome organization and regulation that may provide insight into genome function and evolution.</p>", "title": "Epigenetics", "levelOfInstruction": "undergratuate", "prerequisitesText": "BIO260H1/HMB265H1, BCH311H1/CSB349H1/MGY311Y1", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "", "recommendedPreparation": "", "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Living Things and Their Environment (4)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Science"]}, "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Living Things", "description": "BR=4 Living Things and Their Environment", "code": "BR=4"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": "<strong>Delivery Instructions</strong>\n<br>\n<p>Most class activities will be online synchronous.&nbsp; However, recordings of lectures and some class activities will also be available for students to view asynchronously.
