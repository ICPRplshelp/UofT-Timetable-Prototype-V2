The goal is not to unproblematically celebrate his achievements, but rather to think \u201cthrough\u201d Fellini about synchronous and asynchronous theoretical debates, and to examine the viability of monographic courses as a pedagogical model in 21st century film studies. The assigned readings will bring complexity, relevance, and nuance to this attempt to interrogate, rather than just demolish, the \"old master\" paradigm. This course is part of a year-long research project on Federico Fellini that includes a fall retrospective at TIFF and an international conference in Toronto (October 16-17).
