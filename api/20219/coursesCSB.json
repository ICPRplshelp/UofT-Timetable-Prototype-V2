The course will be based on the primary research literature and involve a combination of lectures and critical discussions of research papers.</p>", "title": "Pathogenic Effector Biology", "levelOfInstruction": "undergratuate", "prerequisitesText": "BCH311H1/CSB349H1/MGY311Y1", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "", "recommendedPreparation": "MGY377H1", "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Living Things and Their Environment (4)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Science"]}, "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Living Things", "description": "BR=4 Living Things and Their Environment", "code": "BR=4"}]}], "notes": []}, {"name": "Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation", "code": "CSB457H1", "sectionCode": "S", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20221"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC5101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "5101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 1, "millisofday": 61200000}, "end": {"day": 1, "millisofday": 64800000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "SS", "buildingRoomNumber": "2127", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20221"}, {"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 61200000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 68400000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "SS", "buildingRoomNumber": "2127", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20221"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "J.", "lastName": "Calarco"}], "currentEnrolment": "24", "maxEnrolment": "24", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": "P", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20221", "mode": "INPER"}], "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": "March 14, 2022: Room changed."}], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "<p>This course focuses on advances in post-transcriptional gene regulation.
