As peoples have moved in the world, food has played a central role in (re)defining who they are, reproducing myth and ritual, and bounding diasporic communities. This course seeks to address questions surrounding the dynamics of the food \u2018we\u2019 eat, the ways in which \u2018we\u2019 eat, the meaning \u2018we\u2019 give to eating, and the effect of eating in a transnational world. Recognizing that culinary culture is central to diasporic identifications, the focus is on the place of food in the enduring habits, rituals, and everyday practices that are collectively used to produce and sustain a shared sense of diasporic cultural identity.</p>", "title": "Diasporic Foodways", "levelOfInstruction": "undergratuate", "prerequisitesText": "14 FCE, including DTS200Y1", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "", "recommendedPreparation": "", "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Society and its Institutions (3)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Humanities, Social Science"]}, "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Society Institutions", "description": "BR=3 Society and Its Institutions", "code": "BR=3"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": "<strong>Timetable Instructions</strong>\n<br>\n\n<p>After the priority enrolment period ends on ACORN, please email the Department to enrol at cdts@utoronto.ca.</p>\n\n<strong>Delivery Instructions</strong>\n<br>\n<p>Enrolment is closed.</p>"}]}, {"name": "The Diasporic Imagination", "code": "DTS412H1", "sectionCode": "S", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20221"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 50400000}, "end": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 57600000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "SK", "buildingRoomNumber": "100", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20221"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "E.", "lastName": "Sammons"}], "currentEnrolment": "26", "maxEnrolment": "26", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": "PE", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20221", "mode": "CLASS"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "<p>This course focuses on echoes of diasporic and transnational life in artistic work, and on the significance of aesthetic production to the formation of diasporic and transnational worlds.
