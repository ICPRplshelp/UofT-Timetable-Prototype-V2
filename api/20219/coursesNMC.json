Interviews with women in <em>Exiled Memories</em> give voice to repressed memories that inhibited female self-development. The memoir <em>Reveille for a Persian Village</em> reveals the challenge of introducing change for females into an isolated rural community<em>. </em>Poems by this early generation vividly reveal their anger, regret, difficulties, and hopes for the future. <em>Memories of a Persian Childhood</em> helps us to appreciate the important role of childhood experience in later choices.
