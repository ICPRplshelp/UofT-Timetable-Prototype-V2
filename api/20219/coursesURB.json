The goal is to introduce students to intellectually rigorous, diverse, and critical debates on the nexus of policing, racialization, immigration, and urban security governance. We aim to problematize the common-sense understanding of \u2018race riots\u2019 through a historically grounded engagement with the politics of fear around the figures of the racialized excluded in Western cities (i.e. the native, the Black, the immigrant, the Muslim). We start by engaging with the roles of racialization, uneven development, and policing in the making of the figures of the criminal and the outlaw within the broader sociospatial relations of capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, and urbanization. Highlighting the importance of the conjuncture of decolonization, we focus on the racial, political, and sociospatial forces of \u2018race riots\u2019; the geo-political fear of the racialized excluded; the making and cementing of the criminalized figures of the Black, the immigrant, and the Muslim; along with the emergence and suppression of Black radicalism and anti-racist politics. We then assess the forceful, yet shadowed, afterlives of \u2018race riots\u2019 in the co-constitution of urban policy, policing, and citizenship, and how these afterlives have affected the current Black Lives Matter protests on both sides of the Atlantic. We conclude by discussing what these histories would and could mean for social justice and urban citizenship in our conjuncture.</p>"}]}, {"name": "Special Topics in Urban Studies", "code": "URB433H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20219"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC9901", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "9901", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 64800000}, "end": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 72000000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20219"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "A.", "lastName": "Webb"}], "currentEnrolment": "7", "maxEnrolment": "30", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "Monuments Must Fall: Re-imagining Public Space through Art and Action", "enrolmentInd": "P", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20219", "mode": "ONLSYNC"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "<p>Special topics courses are offered periodically for senior students in the Urban Studies Program.

Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid densification and privatization bring additional pressures to bear on our conventional urban design models and understanding of urban public space, in both interior and exterior environments. In examining contested public space through the frame of monuments, public art and public actions, how may we begin to imagine new design models for flexible and resilient spaces? In facing an unknown future, how may public art inform design practices to support an open, social and welcoming urban environment? ***Students who took INI337H1S in the Summer 2021 Session (July to August) should not enrol in this course.***</p>\n\n<strong>Delivery Instructions</strong>\n<br>\n<p>Lectures are live-streamed and recorded.
