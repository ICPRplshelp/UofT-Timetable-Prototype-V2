Situated squarely within the study of religion, this course considers how different traditions from around the world and for thousands of years have raised similar questions about happiness\u2014not simply for the sake of reflection but also to do something about it. And their answers have varied: fast, meditate, pray, go to the desert, come together, get high, suffer, renounce God, and/or make lots of money.
