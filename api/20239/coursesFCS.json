The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the extensive variation that exists throughout the French-speaking world. Topics to be covered include phonetics (pronunciation), lexicology (word selection) and morpho-syntax (grammar). This course is taught in English. No knowledge of French or linguistics is required.
