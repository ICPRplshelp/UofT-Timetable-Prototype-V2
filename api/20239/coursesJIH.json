Topics include a comparative examination of Indigenous experiences of colonialism, including treaties and land surrenders as well as the development of government policies aimed at removing and/or assimilating Great Lakes peoples.

Students explore oral history and material culture as sources for writing history and discuss ethical research practices for community-based scholarship. In addition to active participation, each student will write a major paper, approximately 15 pages in length, in the form of a review essay on the historiography of either a region or a topic.
