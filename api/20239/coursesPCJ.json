We will begin by understanding different research designs and approaches, then we will look at how important concepts such as conflict and peace are defined and measured in research. We will also look at how data collection varies with different research orientations. In the second part of the course, we will turn our attention to fundamental descriptive statistics tools. We will look at different datasets, learn how to summarize data for different types of variables through graphs and tables, and explore measures of association between variables. The second part of the course will be complemented by more active participation by students who will simultaneously be working on data projects related to peace, conflict, and justice. Throughout the course we will focus primarily on data literacy and its applications to peace, conflict, and justice, and will look at several examples from leading studies in these fields. This will introduce you to important strands of research, while also exposing you to the importance of data literacy: how research methods are applied to investigate issues relating to peace, conflict, and justice, how to critically read and interpret this research, and how to design your own research in these fields.</p>"}], "cancelInd": "N", "subscriptionTtb": "false", "subscriptionOpenData": "false", "tb1Active": "false", "tb2Active": "false", "fullyOnline": "false"}, {"id": "6445bd58c1e5fe000415909b", "name": "Introduction to Peace, Conflict and Justice II", "ucName": null, "code": "PCJ261H1", "sectionCode": "S", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20241"], "sections": [{"name": "TUT0101", "type": "Tutorial", "teachMethod": "TUT", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": "4", "millisofday": "46800000"}, "end": {"day": "4", "millisofday": "50400000"}, "building": {"buildingCode": "OI", "buildingRoomNumber": "5250", "buildingRoomSuffix": null, "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494563", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20241", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}], "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": null, "currentEnrolment": "43", "maxEnrolment": "50", "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20241", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": "0", "enrolmentInd": null, "tbaInd": "N", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": null}], "enrolmentControls": [{"yearOfStudy": "*", "post": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subject": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subjectPost": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "typeOfProgram": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "designation": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "primaryOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "associatedOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "secondOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "adminOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "collaborativeOrgGroupCode": "*", "quantity": "50", "sequence": "1"}]}, {"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": "2", "millisofday": "36000000"}, "end": {"day": "2", "millisofday": "43200000"}, "building": {"buildingCode": "SK", "buildingRoomNumber": "548", "buildingRoomSuffix": null, "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494564", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20241", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}], "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": [{"firstName": "Laura", "lastName": "Garcia Montoya"}], "currentEnrolment": "43", "maxEnrolment": "50", "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20241", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": "0", "enrolmentInd": "R1", "tbaInd": "N", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": null}], "enrolmentControls": [{"yearOfStudy": "*", "post": {"code": null, "name": null}, "subject": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subjectPost": {"code": "ASMAJ1228", "name": "Peace, Conflict, and Justice Major"}, "typeOfProgram": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "designation": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "primaryOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "associatedOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "secondOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "adminOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "collaborativeOrgGroupCode": "*", "quantity": "50", "sequence": "1"}, {"yearOfStudy": "*", "post": {"code": null, "name": null}, "subject": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subjectPost": {"code": "ASSPE1228", "name": "Peace, Conflict, and Justice Specialist"}, "typeOfProgram": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "designation": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "primaryOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "associatedOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "secondOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "adminOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "collaborativeOrgGroupCode": "*", "quantity": "50", "sequence": "2"}]}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "The course reviews theories exploring the causes of conflict, the possibilities for the pursuit of peace, and the role of justice in both.

The model adopted for this term is called Organization Partner Experiences, where teams of students work on a project of importance to a partner organization. While each group of students works on their project, everyone is expected to learn from and provide feedback on the other projects. We will be hosting some of the partner organizations as guests for orientation of the projects and to learn about the work of the organizations. In addition to the partner experience, the course's overarching theme is about inclusion through access to (public) services. The availability and access to public services such as education, health, and public transport is the most potent way to provide the opportunity for upward socio-economic mobility for the poor and most vulnerable in societies. However, often these services fail them in several ways. In this course, we will focus on understanding ways to improve access to various services for some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable segments of societies around the world. Among other things, we seek to understand what is being done and what can be done better to serve the millions of refugees and forcibly displaced living in refugee camps around the world, to provide essential services in slums, to support the growing population of homeless, and, to understand the urban/rural investment gaps in public services. After taking this course, students are expected to acquire a good understanding of the importance of public services for all citizens; to understand the fact that access is often uneven in subtle ways, and to be able to conduct a critical analysis of what can be or is being done about it.</p>"}], "cancelInd": "N", "subscriptionTtb": "false", "subscriptionOpenData": "false", "tb1Active": "false", "tb2Active": "false", "fullyOnline": "false"}, {"id": "6445bd58c1e5fe000415909e", "name": "Special Topics in Peace and Conflict Studies", "ucName": null, "code": "PCJ444H1", "sectionCode": "S", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20241"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": "1", "millisofday": "50400000"}, "end": {"day": "1", "millisofday": "57600000"}, "building": {"buildingCode": "OI", "buildingRoomNumber": "5170", "buildingRoomSuffix": null, "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494563", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20241", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}], "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": [{"firstName": "Alexandra", "lastName": "Rahr"}], "currentEnrolment": "2", "maxEnrolment": "20", "subTitle": "Man of the People: Culture and and History of American Populism and Demagogues", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20241", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": "0", "enrolmentInd": "R1", "tbaInd": "N", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": null}], "enrolmentControls": [{"yearOfStudy": "*", "post": {"code": null, "name": null}, "subject": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subjectPost": {"code": "ASMAJ1228", "name": "Peace, Conflict, and Justice Major"}, "typeOfProgram": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "designation": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "primaryOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "associatedOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "secondOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "adminOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "collaborativeOrgGroupCode": "*", "quantity": "20", "sequence": "1"}, {"yearOfStudy": "*", "post": {"code": null, "name": null}, "subject": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "subjectPost": {"code": "ASSPE1228", "name": "Peace, Conflict, and Justice Specialist"}, "typeOfProgram": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "designation": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "primaryOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "associatedOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "secondOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "adminOrg": {"code": "*", "name": "All"}, "collaborativeOrgGroupCode": "*", "quantity": "20", "sequence": "2"}]}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "Topics vary annually.
