This course will explore the interaction between feminism and Judaism. We will examine how Jewish law (halakhah) sometimes conflicts with ideas of egalitarianism particularly in legal disabilities for women such as divorce, lack of access to high-level Torah study, and discrimination in public religious roles. The traditional exemption of women from the obligation of Torah study had great impact on women\u2019s religious responsibility and status. Various movements within Judaism competed in efforts to resolve these difficulties.

By looking into a selection of topics from the wide territorial span of the Ottoman Empire (Anatolia, the Balkans, and the Arab Middle East) the course seeks to provide insights into the organization, functioning, and transformation of a multi-confessional state and society in the premodern and modern eras.", "title": "Muslims, Christians, and Jews in the Ottoman Empire", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": null, "corequisitesText": null, "exclusionsText": null, "recommendedPreparation": "NMC241H1, NMC278H1, NMC355H1, NMC377Y1", "note": null, "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Society and its Institutions (3)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Humanities"], "publicationSections": ["Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations"], "cmPublicationSections": {"cmPublicationSections": {"section": "Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations", "subSections": {"subSections": "Near and ME-Civilization and Culture"}}}}, "created": "2023-04-27@02:22:11.237", "modified": null, "lastSaved": "0", "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "coSec": {"code": null, "name": null}, "department": {"code": "NMC", "name": "Department of Near & Middle Eastern Civilizations"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": "0.50", "minCredit": "0.50", "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "APSC", "name": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"}, "breadthTypes": [{"type": "Compl Studies", "description": "Complementary Studies", "code": "CS"}]}, {"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"type": "Humanities", "description": "Humanities", "code": "Hum"}, {"type": "Society Institutions", "description": "BR=3 Society and Its Institutions", "code": "BR=3"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": null}], "cancelInd": "N", "subscriptionTtb": "false", "subscriptionOpenData": "false", "tb1Active": "false", "tb2Active": "false", "fullyOnline": "false"}, {"id": "6445bd58c1e5fe000415905a", "name": "The Rise of the Ottomans", "ucName": null, "code": "NMC388H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20239"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC5101", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "5101", "firstMeeting": null, "currentEnrolment": null, "maxEnrolment": null, "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": null, "waitlistInd": null, "deliveryModes": null, "currentWaitlist": null, "enrolmentInd": null, "tbaInd": null, "openLimitInd": null, "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": null}]}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "A survey of the Ottoman Turks from their late 13th\u2013early 14th century origins on the frontiers of the Seljuk, Mongol, and Byzantine empires to their establishment of an Islamic empire.
