With this feedback, and the support of your Coordinator, students make adjustments to their job search approach and develop strategies for success in the following term for both job applications and interview performance. The importance of a job search network and research to tailor and prepare during your job search are also examined. This course is a compulsory requirement for the Arts and Science Co-op programs.
