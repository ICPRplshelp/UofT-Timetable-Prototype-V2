Application requirements and process are presented as part of the JPM300H1 course. Proposals will be reviewed by committee and successful proposals will be matched to a mentor. Not eligible for CR/NCR option. Application required; contact department (undergrad.pharmtox@utoronto.ca) for more information. Students will form teams and develop a research proposal based on either: 1. Faculty led concept requiring further development and testing, which would not normally be funded grants and would be tangential to ongoing research in the lab. 2. Student developed innovative idea that requires further development and testing.
