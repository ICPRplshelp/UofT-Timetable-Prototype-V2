Drawing on theoretical frameworks and current peer-reviewed research from fields including medicine, psychology, nutrition, exercise and fitness, as well as social and cultural studies, students will learn to debate and integrate theoretical and practical concepts relevant to contemporary understandings of what it means to be healthy.

In response to ongoing and new challenges in health care, governments and institutions respond with novel ideas of enacting health care in improved ways. Health care institutions, policy makers, and the public have expectations of highly skilled, knowledgeable, and prepared individuals. As our understanding of health and health systems change, these expectations also change. Keeping up is in part the work of health professions education. Preparing individuals for these dynamic, complex, in some cases unpredictable, and everchanging health care service demands is necessary and complex. In this course, we explore the role and governance, structure, and contemporary multidisciplinary scientific advances of initial and continuing health professions education as a means of supporting the practice and quality of health care. We also explore the future of health professions and how health professions education is working to keep up.", "title": "Health Professions Education", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "<p>HLTB40H3 and 1.5 credits at the C-level in HLT courses from the program requirements from one of the Major/Major Co-operative programs in Health Studies</p>", "corequisitesText": null, "exclusionsText": null, "recommendedPreparation": "<p>HLTC43H3</p>", "note": "<p>Whether students are in health policy, population health or health humanities streams, education of health professions/professionals provides a mechanism (of many) for how health is achieved.
