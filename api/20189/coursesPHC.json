A detailed overview of the most advanced nanotechnology-platforms for drug delivery (i.e., liposomes, block copolymer micelles and polymer-drug conjugates) will be provided with additional discussion of new emerging platforms.  The integration of imaging in drug development and development of theranostics and therapeutic-diagnostic pairs will also be discussed.  Special emphasis on critical evaluation of scientific literature and pre-clinical/clinical studies will be made throughout the course.

More narrowly, we will analyse a breadth of complex policies questions.  Examples include: the research and development global divide, policial issues influences on pharmaceutical policy, how global commitments, such as membership in the World Trade Organization, conflict with or correspond to domestic policy directions and national sovereignty.
