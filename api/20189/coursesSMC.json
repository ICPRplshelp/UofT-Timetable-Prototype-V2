Reflective of the broader logics of media industry conglomeration and convergence, in media franchises movies, television series, novels and comics, games of all kinds, toys and merchandise, paratexts like promotional materials, etc. are linked together in order to maximize profits.  These dense networks of commercial products serve as a platform for new forms of serial narrative and world-building such as \"transmedia storytelling,\" and also generate vibrant, diverse fan cultures that extend far beyond the official franchise and its canonical texts.

This seminar is an introduction to the methods that allow us to understand this process: palaeography, textual criticism, and codicology. You will learn to read and identify the most important forms of handwriting and abbreviations used in Latin manuscripts between the fourth and fifteenth centuries. You will also understand how the process of copying by hand changed texts as we read them today, and the fundamentals of how modern scholars create a critical edition. These skills are essential for anyone wishing to conduct original research on classical and medieval primary sources. We will consider both traditional approaches to these subjects as well as evolving digital techniques.\r\nEvaluation is based on weekly transcriptions of passages from Latin manuscripts from the fourth to fifteenth centuries; an introduction to and an edition of a short text; and an examination."}]}, {"name": "St. Michael's College Independent Studies", "code": "SMC480H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20189"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [], "instructors": [], "currentEnrolment": "0", "maxEnrolment": "9999", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": "E", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20189", "mode": "CLASS"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "An opportunity for students to pursue an independent course of study not otherwise available in the Faculty of Arts and Science.
