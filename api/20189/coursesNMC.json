The epoch-forming movement influenced the central Islamic lands in many ways, affecting the region militarily, ideologically and culturally. This course will provide a historical and thematic survey of the Crusades from an Islamic perspective. It will examine the Muslim response to the Crusades from the beginning of the movement in 1096 to the end of the Crusader presence in the region in 1291. The course will begin with an overview of the Muslims\u2019 politico-military reactions to the Crusader expeditions and the development of the Muslim jihad policies during the 12th and 13th century under different Muslim rulers such as Zengi, Nur al-Din, and Saladin. It will then explore major themes such as the Arabic sources on the Crusades, the Muslim views of the Franks, and the systematic efforts of major Muslim polities, such as the Seljuqs, Zengids, Ayyubids and Mamluks, in forming cultural unity among the Muslims through the establishment of madrasas, Sufi shrines, and advancing the Sunni revival movement. Attention will also be given to the role of Shi\u2018i minorities during this period, aspects of Frankish-Muslim coexistence and cooperation, and cultural and economic exchanges. The course will conclude by examining the legacy of the Crusades in the modern Middle East and its depiction in modern politics, modern Arabic history writing, and in Arabic art and film."}]}, {"name": "Introduction to the Modern Middle East", "code": "NMC278H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20189"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 2, "millisofday": 36000000}, "end": {"day": 2, "millisofday": 41400000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "SS", "buildingRoomNumber": "2108", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20189"}, {"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 36000000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 41400000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "SS", "buildingRoomNumber": "2108", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20189"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "J.", "lastName": "Reilly"}], "currentEnrolment": "41", "maxEnrolment": "88", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20189", "mode": "CLASS"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "The emergence of modern states in the Middle East, against a background of empire, world wars, and national and religious movements.

The discovery of a body of liturgy in Hebrew for Jewish women in Italy containing prayers with mystical language, reference to concepts in the Zohar, and actual ritual practices overturns what has become a truism in Jewish mystical studies, that is, there were no Jewish female mystics. Both Christianity and Islam have strong traditions of female mystics. In these private petitionary prayers called te\u1e25inot, we have ample evidence that there were Jewish female practitioners of mysticism. We will address notions of sin which exiled the Shekhinah, the female essence of God, from the Godhead. For women this begins with the sin in the Garden of Eden. We will examine basic concepts of mystical literature, particularly the reunification of the Shekhinah with the Godhead and the connection of the reunification with ritual purity and sexuality."}]}, {"name": "The Babylonian City", "code": "NMC446H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20189"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 57600000}, "end": {"day": 3, "millisofday": 64800000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "LM", "buildingRoomNumber": "123", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20189"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "H.", "lastName": "Baker"}], "currentEnrolment": "9", "maxEnrolment": "20", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20189", "mode": "CLASS"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "Examines the physical form of the Babylonian city in the first millennium BC as the setting for the daily activities of its inhabitants.
