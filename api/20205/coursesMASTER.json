How can you communicate your ideas more compellingly? INI 409 teaches ways to understand this essential stage of the writing process. It investigates different steps in self-editing: detaching from a first draft, reviewing it on different levels, identifying possible issues, and strengthening weak spots. We will draw on professional editorial strategies and time-tested writing advice to help us analyze both content and expression. Writers in different genres (scholarship, journalism, fiction) will visit the class to share their revision strategies. Each student will need a piece of writing to work on, one that the student wants to improve. It could be an academic essay or a science report from an earlier term, a short story or a piece of creative nonfiction, a newspaper article, or a personal statement for post-graduate applications.

Through an examination of a mix of theoretical frameworks and case studies from Toronto and elsewhere, you will gain an understanding of the ways in which effective public participation can contribute to the maintenance of a healthy democratic society while also exploring some of the key challenges and opportunities faced by public participation practitioners today. The course has two key objectives: to give you a practical understanding of all of the elements of an effective public participation process, and to explore how public participation processes can be designed to be more inclusive and effective.

They will practice reading and understanding mathematical statements, analyzing definitions and properties, formulating conjectures and generalizations, providing and writing reasonable and precise arguments, writing and critiquing proofs. The instructor may use specific mathematical content, which could vary from year to year, to practice these skills. The course is aimed at students interested in the creative character of mathematics, particularly those planning to take any of our proof-oriented courses, and is an excellent preparation for MAT137Y1, MAT157Y1, or MAT240H1. <br /> Note: students may take this course concurrently with MAT157Y1 or MAT137Y1, or prior to registering in MAT157Y1 or MAT137Y1. This course can also be used by students who have already taken MAT136H1 and wish to bridge the gap to MAT237Y1.", "title": "Introduction to Proofs", "levelOfInstruction": "undergratuate",

Additional discussion time in small groups, led by a TA or the instructor, will follow later on Thursday afternoons (time TBA, depending on size of class and student availability). These \u201clive\u201d discussions are recommended, but students who are unable to join the class at that time will be able to use class discussion forums to share their thoughts without penalty for missing the live discussions.  Discussions, Q & A office hours, and webinar lectures will take place using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra through Quercus and will be recorded to allow students to review the video afterwards.  Students need Power Point (available for free through the university), the ability to download or stream videos of lectures, and access to Quercus to use Blackboard Collaborate and discussion forums.  There is a required textbook for this course, which will be available for online purchase through the U of T bookstore and other online vendors (including used copies). The textbook as an ebook can also be purchased or rented for about CAD65. The other required readings for this class are free ebooks or articles available for no cost through the library website."}]}, {"name": "Introduction to International Relations", "code": "POL208Y1", "sectionCode": "Y", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20205"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC5101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "5101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 2, "millisofday": 64800000}, "end": {"day": 2, "millisofday": 72000000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20205"}, {"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 64800000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 72000000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20205"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "M.", "lastName": "Yaniszewski"}], "currentEnrolment": "61", "maxEnrolment": "75", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20205", "mode": "ONL"}], "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": "<br/>Online Asynchronous \u2013 See Timetable Instructions"}], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}, {"name": "TUT5101", "type": "Tutorial", "sectionNumber": "5101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 57600000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 61200000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20205"}], "instructors": [], "currentEnrolment": "13", "maxEnrolment": "25", "teachMethod": "TUT", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20205", "mode": "ONL"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}, {"name": "TUT5201", "type": "Tutorial", "sectionNumber": "5201", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 61200000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 64800000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20205"}], "instructors": [], "currentEnrolment": "20", "maxEnrolment": "25", "teachMethod": "TUT", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20205", "mode": "ONL"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}, {"name": "TUT5301", "type": "Tutorial", "sectionNumber": "5301", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 72000000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 75600000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20205"}], "instructors": [], "currentEnrolment": "18", "maxEnrolment": "25", "teachMethod": "TUT", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20205", "mode": "ONL"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "The course analyzes the impact of the individual, the nation-state, and the international and transnational systems on international conflict and conflict resolution, and examines the major problems the international community confronts in a rapidly changing international environment.", "title": "Introduction to International Relations", "levelOfInstruction": "undergratuate", "prerequisitesText": "1.0 POL credit /4.0 full course equivalents", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "POLB80H3/POLB81H3/POL208Y5", "recommendedPreparation": "Prior reading or study of modern history", "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Society and its Institutions (3)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Social Science"]}, "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Society Institutions", "description": "BR=3 Society and Its Institutions", "code": "BR=3"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": "<strong>Timetable Instructions</strong>\n<br>\n\nThe course will be an online asynchronous course.
