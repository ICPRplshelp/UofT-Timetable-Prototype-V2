Students will gain a breadth of understanding in cannabis-related topics including pharmacology and toxicology, its role in mental health and addictions, medical use, drug policy and new drug development that stems from increased access to cannabis constituents. They will learn to differentiate myths and anecdotes from evidence-based knowledge.
