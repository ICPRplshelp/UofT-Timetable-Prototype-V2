Students will have the opportunity for synchronous online webinar class and/or office hours 1.5 hrs/week (Thursdays at 11:00 am to 12:30 pm). Some weeks this webinar will be, at least partially, a weekly lecture, but will also include opportunities to ask questions and clarifications about lecture and tutorial content.  Additional discussion time in small groups, led by a TA or the instructor, will follow later on Thursday afternoons (time TBA, depending on size of class and student availability). These \u201clive\u201d discussions are recommended, but students who are unable to join the class at that time will be able to use class discussion forums to share their thoughts without penalty for missing the live discussions.  Discussions, Q & A office hours, and webinar lectures will take place using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra through Quercus and will be recorded to allow students to review the video afterwards.  Students need Power Point (available for free through the university), the ability to download or stream videos of lectures, and access to Quercus to use Blackboard Collaborate and discussion forums.  There is a required textbook for this course, which will be available for online purchase through the U of T bookstore and other online vendors (including used copies).
