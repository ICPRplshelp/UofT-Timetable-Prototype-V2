What is state capacity and what are its components? What is the infrastructural power of the state and how does it differ from the despotic power of a state? How do state efforts to extend infrastructural power ignite political battles for social control at both elite and popular sector levels of society? Finally, how do processes of state formation unfold over time?

We will consider the ways in which youth and children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\r\nlived experiences are often shaped by social, political, and economic factors outside of their own control as well as the different social locations in which they are situated. In this course, race, gender, sex, class, and disability will all be relevant in exploring questions of both the rights of children and youth as well as ethical responsibilities to them at global and local levels. We will also examine how personhood has been defined historically, and the way its meaning has changed over time to shape the lives of children and youth. As part of this course, students will learn how the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) attend to the specific issues shaping the development and well-being of youth and children. This course will run as a seminar with interactive lectures, class discussions, audiovisual technologies, and case studies. Class materials will draw from research articles, social media, online resources, blogs, and print media, to center the lives of youth and children in the context of international development.</p>"}], "cancelInd": "", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false, "primaryFull": false, "fullyOnline": false}, {"id": "6634eea30b7d9d3dbe57fa47", "name": "Populism, Development, and Globalization in the Global South", "ucName": null, "code": "IDSC16H3", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "Scarborough", "sessions": ["20249"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC01", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "01", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 2, "millisofday": 39600000}, "end": {"day": 2, "millisofday": 46800000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "AA", "buildingRoomNumber": "", "buildingRoomSuffix": "", "buildingUrl": "https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/493687", "buildingName": null}, "sessionCode": "20249", "repetition": "WEEKLY", "repetitionTime": "ONCE_A_WEEK"}], "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": [{"firstName": "Judith Ann", "lastName": "Teichman"}], "currentEnrolment": 11, "maxEnrolment": 40, "subTitle": "", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20249", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": 0, "enrolmentInd": "", "tbaInd": "N", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": ""}], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": null}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "The rise of populism has been widespread and often linked to processes of economic globalization.

Aid and development funding has always been political, tied to the priorities of donor nations and their foreign policy objectives, as well as to the aspirations of those working within and directing the activities of development agencies.  However, over the last two decades, international development has been increasingly financed and implemented by a nexus of billionaires and corporate foundations. From the Gates Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 green revolution in Africa, to the Clinton Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s engagement in the Global Fund, both the capital and the goals that structure development policy and practice internationally have been shaped by the interests of the wealthy and the associated tools of celebrity humanitarianism and corporate social responsibility.  The role of the weathy in national development, however, is not a new phenomenon.  The act of moral cleansing through the provision of public infrastructure and reformist social policy by 19th century robber barons and industrialists like Andrew Carnegie, the Rockefellers or the Vanderbilts in North America, presage what we see on the global stage today.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn this course, we will examine the recent rise of philanthrocapitalism, and its explicit ties to, and intersections with, development policy and practice.  We will evaluate the political opportunities that facilitate a role for corporate capital and private wealth in development practice, and consider the range of impacts that this increasing role of transnational wealth plays in shaping the futures of people around the globe. \r\n</p>"}], "cancelInd": "N", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false, "primaryFull": false, "fullyOnline": false}, {"id": "663e5329c1f9a71b49e0ac19", "name": "Directed Reading", "ucName": null, "code": "IDSD14H3", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "Scarborough", "sessions": ["20249"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC01", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "01", "meetingTimes": [], "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": [{"firstName": "", "lastName": "FACULTY"}], "currentEnrolment": 1, "maxEnrolment": 9999, "subTitle": "", "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "Y", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20249", "mode": "INPER"}], "currentWaitlist": 0, "enrolmentInd": "A", "tbaInd": "N", "openLimitInd": "N", "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": ""}], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": null}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "The goal of the course is for students to examine in a more extensive fashion the academic literature on a particular topic in International Development Studies not covered by existing course offering.
