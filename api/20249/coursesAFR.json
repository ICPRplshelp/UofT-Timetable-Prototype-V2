To understand the complexities of food insecurity and to explore possible pathways for a food-secure Africa, we ask: what is the nexus between food security, climate change, and sustainability in Africa? How is food security intertwined with livelihood security, rights, justice, resource governance, conflicts, natural disasters, uncertainties, and risks and vulnerabilities? What are the challenges and opportunities for sustainable futures in Africa? Which theoretical frameworks illuminate these complexities? Students will learn through case study analyses, guest lectures, modeling and scenario-building exercises, and engagement with indigenous knowledge systems, canonical and emergent interdisciplinary scholarship on the topic.", "title": "Climate Change, Food Security, and Sustainability in Africa", "levelOfInstruction": null, "prerequisitesText": "<p>Completion of 6.0 credits</p>", "corequisitesText": null, "exclusionsText": "<p>AFR459H1 (Topic: <i>Climate Change, Food Security and Sustainability in Africa</i>), offered in Winter 2022 and Winter 2024</p>", "recommendedPreparation": "<p>AFR150Y1 or AFR290H1 or interested students with relevant background</p>", "note": null, "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Society and its Institutions (3)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Social Science"], "publicationSections": ["African Studies"], "cmPublicationSections": [{"section": "African Studies", "subSections": null}]}, "created": "2024-04-17@22:07:24.514", "modified": null, "lastSaved": 0, "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "coSec": {"code": "", "name": null}, "department": {"code": "AFR", "name": "African Studies Centre"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": 0.5, "minCredit": 0.5, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Society Institutions", "description": "BR=3 Society and Its Institutions", "code": "BR=3"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": ""}], "cancelInd": "", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "fullyOnline": false, "primaryFull": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false}]}
