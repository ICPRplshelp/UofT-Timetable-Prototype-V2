Topics covered include subsurface imaging and surveying, catastrophe modelling, Martian seismology, stress and strain principles, wave theory, data inversion, and data science applications on seismic data analysis.", "title": "Seismology and Seismic Methods", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "<p>[MATA36H3 <em>or</em> MATA37H3] and PHYA10H3</p>", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "<p>JPE493H1</p>", "recommendedPreparation": "<p>EESB15H3, EESB26H3</p>", "note": null, "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "breadthRequirements": ["Natural Sciences"], "distributionRequirements": null, "publicationSections": ["Environmental Science"], "cmPublicationSections": [{"section": "Environmental Science", "subSections": null}]}, "created": "2024-05-31@22:36:28.146", "modified": null, "lastSaved": 0, "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "SCAR", "name": "University of Toronto Scarborough"}, "coSec": {"code": "", "name": null}, "department": {"code": "PESSC", "name": "Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sci (UTSC)"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": 0.5, "minCredit": 0.5, "breadths": [], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": "<p class=\"info\"><b>Enrolment Indicator: P</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Initially restricted to students in the following groups:</b>\r\n<br>\r\nSCSPE0351A - Specialist Program in Environmental Geoscience\r\n<br>\r\nSCSPE1076B - Specialist Program in Environmental Physics\r\n<br><br>\r\nEnrolment will open to all UTSC students at <b>10:00 am on July 24, 2024. </b>Enrolment will open to UTSG and UTM students on <b>August 2, 2024</b>.</p>"}], "cancelInd": "N", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false, "fullyOnline": false, "primaryFull": false}, {"id": "6634eea30b7d9d3dbe57f913", "name": "Environmental Microbiology", "ucName": null, "code": "EESC30H3", "sectionCode": "S", "campus": "Scarborough", "sessions": ["20251"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC01", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "01", "meetingTimes": null, "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": null, "currentEnrolment": null, "maxEnrolment": null, "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": null, "waitlistInd": null, "deliveryModes": [], "currentWaitlist": null, "enrolmentInd": null, "tbaInd": null, "openLimitInd": null, "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": ""}], "enrolmentControls": null, "linkedMeetingSections": null}, {"name": "PRA0001", "type": "Practical", "teachMethod": "PRA", "sectionNumber": "0001", "meetingTimes": null, "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": null, "currentEnrolment": null, "maxEnrolment": null, "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": null, "waitlistInd": null, "deliveryModes": [], "currentWaitlist": null, "enrolmentInd": null, "tbaInd": null, "openLimitInd": null, "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": null, "linkedMeetingSections": null}, {"name": "PRA0002", "type": "Practical", "teachMethod": "PRA", "sectionNumber": "0002", "meetingTimes": null, "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": null, "currentEnrolment": null, "maxEnrolment": null, "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": null, "waitlistInd": null, "deliveryModes": [], "currentWaitlist": null, "enrolmentInd": null, "tbaInd": null, "openLimitInd": null, "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": null, "linkedMeetingSections": null}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "This course examines the diversity of microorganisms, their adaptations to special habitats, and their critical role in the ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles.
