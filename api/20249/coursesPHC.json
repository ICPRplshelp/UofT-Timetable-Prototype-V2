The integration of imaging in drug development and development of theranostics and therapeutic-diagnostic pairs will also be discussed. Special emphasis on critical evaluation of scientific literature and pre-clinical/clinical studies will be made throughout the course.", "title": "Nanomedicines in Oncology", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "PHC230H1, PHC330H1 and enrolled as a Year 4 student in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry specialist program.", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "", "recommendedPreparation": "", "note": null, "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Living Things and Their Environment (4)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Science"], "publicationSections": ["Chemistry"], "cmPublicationSections": [{"section": "Chemistry", "subSections": null}]}, "created": "2024-04-17@22:08:29.453", "modified": null, "lastSaved": 0, "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "coSec": {"code": "", "name": null}, "department": {"code": "CHM", "name": "Department of Chemistry"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": 0.5, "minCredit": 0.5, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Living Things", "description": "BR=4 Living Things and Their Environment", "code": "BR=4"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": ""}], "cancelInd": "N", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "fullyOnline": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false, "primaryFull": false}, {"id": "66193fb80b7d9d3dbe57efa4", "name": "Global Pharmaceutical Policy", "ucName": null, "code": "PHC470H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20249"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "teachMethod": "LEC", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": null, "firstMeeting": null, "instructors": null, "currentEnrolment": null, "maxEnrolment": null, "subTitle": null, "cancelInd": null, "waitlistInd": null, "deliveryModes": [], "currentWaitlist": null, "enrolmentInd": null, "tbaInd": null, "openLimitInd": null, "notes": [{"name": "Section Note", "type": "SECTION", "content": ""}], "enrolmentControls": null, "linkedMeetingSections": null}], "duration": null, "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "This course is designed for students who are interested in the critical analysis of global health policy and the interrelationship between global and domestic policy issues. The course will introduce students generally to the basic concepts and issues in global health with a particular focus on pharmaceutical policy. We will address key issues in health and discuss core institutional and transnational actors, how governments in different jurisdictions manage public health responsibilities, the tension between economic imperatives and health objectives, global obligations, and pressure from special interest groups. More narrowly, we will analyze a breadth of complex policies questions. Examples include: the research and development global divide, policial issues influences on pharmaceutical policy, how global commitments, such as membership in the World Trade Organization, conflict with or correspond to domestic policy directions and national sovereignty.
