Biology is the science of living things, and yet, paradoxically, living things--organisms--have been comprehensively left out of the Modern Synthesis theory of evolution that developed in the twentieth century. This course surveys the reasons--historical, philosophical and empirical--for the marginalization of organisms from evolutionary theory. It examines the ways in which evolutionary developmental biology attempts to restore the organisms to a central place in evolutionary biology. Offered by faculty in the Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology.", "title": "History and Philosophy of Evolutionary Biology", "levelOfInstruction": "undergraduate", "prerequisitesText": "<p>6.0 credits, of which 1.0 credit is from EEB/ BIO/ HPS courses</p>", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "", "recommendedPreparation": "JHE353H1", "note": null, "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Society and its Institutions (3)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Humanities", "Science"], "publicationSections": ["Ecology and Evolutionary Biology", "History and Philosophy of Science and Technology"], "cmPublicationSections": [{"section": "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology", "subSections": null}, {"section": "History and Philosophy of Science and Technology", "subSections": null}]}, "created": "2024-04-17@22:08:14.397", "modified": null, "lastSaved": 0, "primaryTeachMethod": "LEC", "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "coSec": {"code": "EEB", "name": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology"}, "department": {"code": "IHPST", "name": "Inst. for the History & Philosophy of Science & Technology"}, "title": null, "maxCredit": 0.5, "minCredit": 0.5, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "APSC", "name": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "ELECTIVE", "type": "Compl Studies", "description": "Complementary Studies", "code": "CS"}, {"kind": "ELECTIVE", "type": "Hum&SocSci", "description": "Humanities & Social Sciences", "code": "HSS"}]}, {"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Society Institutions", "description": "BR=3 Society and Its Institutions", "code": "BR=3"}]}], "notes": [{"name": "Course Note", "type": "COURSE", "content": ""}], "cancelInd": "", "subscriptionTtb": false, "subscriptionOpenData": false, "tb1Active": false, "tb2Active": false, "fullyOnline": false, "primaryWaitlistable": false, "primaryFull": false}]}
